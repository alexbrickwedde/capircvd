# structure of capircvd.conf:
#  this file contains several "sections" each beginning with a
#  "=sectionname". This sections contain "option value"
#  combinations. Samples later in this file...
#
# Every option has to be written in lowercase letters !
# Alle Optionen und Werte müssen in Kleinbuchstaben geschrieben sein! 
#
# !!! ATTENTION !!! Configure every option!
#  Missing options may result in loss of data !
#  or can cause capircvd to crash !!!
#
#

# The "global"-section:
# iprefix	string		# The prefix for your country, 1 for USA,
				# 49 for germany and so on
# nprefix	string		# The prefix for your region, 89 for munich
				# 5921 for nordhorn and so on
=global
iprefix		49
nprefix		5921
onerror		exit

# Using the controller-section you can activate some
# options for a specific controller. the number following
# specifies the controllernumber, i.e.: "=controller1"
# is for the first controller!
#
# Options are:
# numlength	integer		# specifies the number of digits
				# to be dialled by the caller

# prefix	string		# when a call arrives this number
				# is placed in front of the
				# calledpartynumber, useful
				# if your ISDN-equipment doesn't
				# transmit the whole number
				# !!! this number is placed in front of
				# the callednumber everytime !!!
# dontuse	boolean		# 'false' if you whish to use the controller
      				# which is default. 'true' if capircvd
				# shouldn't touch anything on this
				# controller!
# maxfax	integer		# how many b-channels can be used
				# for faxing...(not implemented/used!!!)
# onerror	string		# what to on error, if set to "exit"
				# known bugs cause capircvd to quit!

# the admin-section contains the password for the 'root'-user
# used only for telnet-session, which can be activated here...
#
# Options are:
# password	string		# sets the password for 'root'
# telnet	boolean		# 'true' activates the telnet-server
				# for remotecontrol of capircvd
# telnetport	integer		# defines the tcp-port the server
				# is running on (default: 20013)
# debug		integer		# changes debugmode (like cmdline)
				# cmdline overrides!

# The use of the telnet-server is not recommended for open environments
# use it only if you and all users from "passwd"-section know what they do!!!
# A better approach would be the use of a database with webinterface
# and a script which creates "capircvd.conf" from this database.
#  maybe this will be implemented later...

# every section containing an option "user username"

# Do not create a user 'root', the admin/password is for user 'root'!

# the callednumber-section
# the name of the section is the calledpartynumber!
# options for this section configure the handling of an

#
# Options are:
# mode		string		# defines what is being done with the call
				# these modes exist:

# mode ignore		# call is being ignored
			# no more options used!

# mode deflect		# activates calldeflect
			# valid options for deflect-mode are:

			# "later" means: after the announcement

			# you can use own programs if yuo wish

			# see sourcecode of capircvd.handler
# recipient string	# the mailadress the file is being sent to.
			# You can use other values if using an other

# mailformat		# defines the format of the mail being sent.
			# in mode voice this options is ignored
			# in fax mode you can use
			# 'inline_jpeg' you receive mails with inline-images
			# 'attached_pdf_zip' send a zip containing a pdf-file

# filename string	# describes how filenames generated look like:
                        #       Parameters:

#	!!! ATTENTION !!! Use only correct formatstrings otherwise it is

#     	Don't use the character ":" !!!

#

# mode fax		# for receiving faxes, options are all of voice-options
			# and these ones:
# faxid	string		# The local faxid. The sender of a fax receives this
			# string. If the number of your fax is 495921851234
			# use this string: +49_5921_851234
			# '_' are replaced by a ' ' internally. Using real ' '
			# won't work because of limitations of the configfile

# mode ping		# gives you a "ping"-Interface. Enter the IP in octal
			# (10.1.0.1 is 01200200001, always with a starting 0)
                        # using DTMF and end with "#". Or enter in dotted quad
			# (10.1.0.1) with an "*" as "." and end it with "#",
			# i.e. press "10*1*0*1#" to test 10.1.0.1 !
			# It will try to ping and answer what's up...
			# You can use delay-option to set delay-time
			# Other options are senseless...
			# BE CAREFUL! While fping is running
			# nothing else works!!! Use ony if absolutely 
			# necessary!!! In future versions this behaviour
			# will be changed (maybe in 0.2.193 :-) ...
			# Use in a callingparty subsection to control use!
